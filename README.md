Welcome to my Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a complete data warehousing and analytics solution, from ingestion to reporting. It’s designed as a portfolio project that highlights data engineering and analytics best practices.

# ======================================================================================

🏗️ Data Architecture

The data warehouse follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers):


Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server.

Silver Layer: Cleansed, standardized, and normalized data prepared for analytics.

Gold Layer: Business-ready data modeled into a Star Schema for reporting and dashboards.

# ===================================================================================

📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

Data Architecture: Building a modern Data Warehouse with Medallion layers.

ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from ERP & CRM systems.

Data Modeling: Designing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytics.

Analytics & Reporting: Generating insights with SQL queries and dashboards.

# ========================================================================================

🎯 Skills Showcased

This project demonstrates hands-on expertise in:

SQL Development

Data Architecture

Data Engineering

ETL Pipeline Development
